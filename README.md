## Welcome

## About the Project
The objective of this project is to create a Business Directory for B2B (*business to business*) and B2C (*business to consumer*) purposes. Users can buy a listing by paying for it using a credit card function on the website.


## User Stories
As a consumer, I want to a place to search for businesses and products. It should be easy to find products and services by entering a search term.
As a consumer, I want to be able to filter the entries so that I can find the best results based on the type of thing that I am searching for and where I am located.

As a business, I want to create an entry on a business directory to display my business to attract new clients. It should be easy and fast to create an account and be able to fill in the details of the businesses.
As a business, I want to be able to easily edit the account or, if need be, delete the account.

## User Experience
It should be easy to search for a product or a service in a search bar on the home page.
It should be easy to filter the entries by various criteria such as business type, location, business category, etc.
It should be easy to navigate around the website to move from entry to entry and to return to the home page.
The information in the entries should be clearly laid out and easy to read.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to make the business directory as I came across a business directory that was very clumsy and shoddy in the way that it was designed. I particularly like the [Manta business directory](http://www.manta.com).

## Testing
There was constant testing of the code during the design and construction of this website. Things frequently did not work and they had to be modified or sometimes changed entirely in order to get it to work. Html files were put through the HTML Validator to ensure that they were correct and error free.
The logging in and creation of new listings generated plenty of errors and those files had to be changed numerous times in order to get them to function as desired. That can be seen in the changes in the app.py and create.html, login.html, signup.html, edit.html files.  MondoDB had to consulted continuously to confirm that data entered into the website during registration and editing was received.
The layout and appearance underwent considerable change during the design. As more pages and functions were added to the website, the appearance was found unsuitable so a new approach had to be undertaken. That is why the background image was removed and gradient colours were placed as a background.


## Future Development
The current website, as is stands, is to represent how a directory would function. The plan for future development is to add to the website and the directory so that it has more functions such being able to add photographs to the listings, being able to pay for a premium listing on the home page, more categories and filters so that users can search more to find their desired business. Users would be able to navigate the website better with buttons in order to move listings.
